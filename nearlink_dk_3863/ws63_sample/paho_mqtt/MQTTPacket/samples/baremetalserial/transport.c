This simple low-level implementation assumes a single connection for a single thread. Thus, single static
variables are used for that connection.
On other scenarios, you might want to put all these variables into a structure and index via the 'sock'
parameter, as some functions show in the comments
The blocking rx function is not supported.
If you plan on writing one, take into account that the current implementation of
MQTTPacket_read() has a function pointer for a function call to get the data to a buffer, but no provisions
to know the caller or other indicator (the socket id): int (*getfn)(unsigned char*, int)
